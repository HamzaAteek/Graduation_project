## How I builed the project

\*\*I used:

- react frame work with vite in Front End.
- rawg io API from its website.
- React-dom library to navigate between pages smoothly.
- the Tailwind library to add formatting to the project while maintaining responsiveness to all devices.
- React-Query for fetch the datd from API.
- State Managment (Context-useReducer) for sharing the props during the project because Context and useReducer are natively supported in React, eliminating the need for third-party dependencies like Zustand. This reduces bundle size and keeps the project lightweight.
- I divided the project into components, pages, and hooks to make the code easier to work with.
- Upload the project in Vercel for share it to public.
